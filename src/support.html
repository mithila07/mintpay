                            <p>Mintpay aids you to have better control over your finance. However, the delivery and quality of the goods and services you buy is always the responsibility of the retailer. This means that you need to get in touch with the retailer if a delivery is taking longer or something is missing or damaged. This also means that once an order is approved, only the retailer can change the order.</p>
